To build the app with a custom icon:

1. Create or download a 512x512 PNG icon
2. Save it as: icon.png (in this folder)
3. Run build-app.bat

Recommended icon design:
- Whiteboard/camera theme
- Clear and simple at small sizes
- Square aspect ratio (512x512)

You can create one at:
- https://www.canva.com (free icon maker)
- https://www.figma.com
- Or use any image editor

For now, the app will build with Electron's default icon.
